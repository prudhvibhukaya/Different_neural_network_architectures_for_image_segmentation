# Different_neural_network_architectures_for_image_segmentation

Semantic segmentation datasets can be quite unbalanced, which means that pixels from one class may be more prevalent inside of pictures than those from other classes. The imbalance issue can be resolved by weighing the loss function to take this into account as segmentation issues can be considered as per-pixel classification issues. It's an elegant and straightforward solution to this issue. To avoid ambiguity, Model.fit does not support the class_weight argument for targets with 3+ dimensions.
Therefore, in this instance, we ust carry out the weighing out. To do this, use sample weights: Model.fit additionally accepts (data, label, sample_weight) triples in addition to (data, label) pairs. Model Keras.The losses and metrics, which also take a sample_weight parameter, are affected by fit's propagation of the sample_weight. Prior to the reduction process, the sample weight is multiplied by the sample value.
The function we need to create sample weights so that we must agree to use a (data, label) pair as input and output a (data, label, sample_weight) triple, where sample_weight is a 1-channel image that contains the class weight for each pixel. Using the label as an index into a class_weight list is the most straightforward approach possible.
Where steps_per_epoch=100 we can see it took 12s 119ms/step - loss: 0.0377 - accuracy: 0.9440
